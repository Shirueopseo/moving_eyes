# moving_eyes

A simple HTML page that shows an image with eyes that rotates following the mouse movement.
Then a JS function is activated w/ a listener when mouse moves, taking x & y to calculate the angle between the mouse position and the anchor of
each eye (which is the central point of the eyes images).
